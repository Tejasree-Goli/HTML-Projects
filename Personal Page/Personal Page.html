			<h3> About Me: </h3>
			<p> Hey There! I'm a recent computer engineering graduate student at San Jose State University, where I gained expertise in 
				Data Mining, Business Intelligence Technologies, Machine Learning, Math for Data Science, Deep Learning, Software Security
				 Technologies, and Natural Language Processing concepts and applications. With this knowledge, I'm eager to collaborate 
				 with dynamic teams and organizations to use data for driving positive business outcomes. </p>
			<p> Before my academic journey, I entered into the data landscape as a Data Analyst at Accenture in India. Here, I worked on 
				Big Data technologies, converting raw information into actionable insights. Collaborating with the Director of Facilities 
				at SRAC, SJSU, I've conducted operations research, crafted surveys, analyzed responses, and improved workflows for maximum 
				efficiency. With this diverse skill set, I'm poised to captivate the data-driven world, crafting stories and solutions that 
				leave an indelible mark on industries. </p>
			<p> Beyond my academic and professional pursuits, I'm also an avid enthusiast with a diverse range of interests. I have a deep 
				appreciation for outdoor sports, particularly Formula 1 racing, which has recently captured my attention. When I'm not 
				immersed in the sports world, I dive deep into the pages of books ("The Alchemist" holds a special place in my heart from the
				 fiction genre, as it masterfully weaves life lessons into a captivating story). Traveling is another passion that fuels my 
				 curiosity, allowing me to explore new cultures and gain fresh perspectives. I often channel my thoughts and experiences into 
				 my blog, where I document my journeys and reflections.</p>
